## ES6 and Webpack
<p>
This project was my first introduction to webpack and ES6 Modules. Throughout the process I learned practices on how to apply
ES6 Modules to my code as well as multiple resources to reference when using webpack. I refined my usage of DOM Manipulation with this project.
More then 80% of this project is made using javascript. There is also some slight usage of node.
